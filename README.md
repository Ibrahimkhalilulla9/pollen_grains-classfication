# 🌾 Pollen's Profiling: Automated Classification of Pollen Grains

An AI-powered system for automated classification of pollen grains using deep learning and image processing techniques. This project supports applications in environmental monitoring, allergy diagnostics, and agricultural research.

## 🧠 Overview

**Pollen's Profiling** is a deep learning-based image classification system designed to identify and categorize pollen grains based on their morphological features (shape, size, and texture). The system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on microscopic images to provide fast and accurate predictions.
